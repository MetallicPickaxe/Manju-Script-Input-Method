# Using Manju IME

This manual explains how to type Manchu with Manju IME, an input method editor (IME) for Windows. It
starts with what the IME does, then goes through typing one word, the window that shows the word, and
every key the IME uses. [Installing Manju IME](installation.md) covers setup.

## What Manju IME does

On a keyboard, each key normally puts one letter into your document. Manju IME works in two steps. First,
the letters you type go into a small window beside the text, the candidate window, which shows them as a
Manchu word; the document shows a mark where the word will go. Then, when you press **Space**, the word
goes into the document in Manchu letters. Until then you can add letters, delete them, or pick another
form of a letter.

You spell each word in Latin letters, with one of six input schemes: [Input Schemes](romanisation.md)
shows each of them letter by letter.

## Switch to Manju IME

Press **Win+Space** and pick Manju IME. It is listed under the language you chose in Setup.

## Type a word

1. Type the letters of a word, for example `nama`. The candidate window opens beside the text and shows
   ᠨᠠᠮᠠ.
2. Press **Space**. ᠨᠠᠮᠠ goes into your document, and the candidate window closes.

*The candidate window after typing `šanyan` with the Möllendorff input scheme: `s`, a tap of
**Shift**, then `anyan`.*

## The candidate window

The candidate window has two parts.

- **The letters typed**, on the left: one row for each letter of the word. A letter spelled with two
  Latin letters takes one row, such as `ng`, and so does a whole syllable, such as `sy`. One row is
  highlighted: at first the last one.
- **The cards**, on the right: each card shows the whole word, with a different form of the letter
  of the highlighted row. The first line of a card names the form: `base` is the plain form, and
  `variant FVS1` is the form that free variation selector 1 (U+180B) selects. Then come the position of
  the letter in the word, such as `final`, and the letter’s code point, the number Unicode gives it.

*`ng` is one letter in every scheme and takes one row: `angga` (mouth), typed with the Möllendorff input
scheme.*

![Two candidate windows with the Möllendorff input scheme: sy typed, where the letters typed show sy in one row, and jytu typed, where they show jy, t, and u, one row each](images/syllables.png)

*A whole syllable is one row too: `sy`, and the `jy` of `jytu`, typed with the Möllendorff input scheme.*

![The candidate window after typing angga with the Möllendorff input scheme and pressing Up twice: the row of ng is highlighted, and the cards show ng joined with the g after it](images/ng-ligature.png)

*Followed by `g`, `ng` is drawn as one glyph with it: `angga` with the row of `ng` highlighted, after
**Up** twice, in the Möllendorff input scheme.*

![Two candidate windows with the Möllendorff input scheme: gisun typed, with two cards, and bithe typed, with four cards; each card shows the whole word with one form of its last letter](images/glyphs.png)

*Each card shows another form of the highlighted letter: `gisun` and `bithe`, typed with the Möllendorff
input scheme.*

## Keys

The table is for Manchu input; in Latin input every key works as it does without an IME. While you type a
word, the keys act on the word. When you are not typing a word, most keys go to the program you type in, as
they would without an IME.

| Key | While you type a word | When you are not typing a word |
|---|---|---|
| A letter | Adds the letter to the word. A letter that the input scheme does not use joins the letters typed as itself, and goes into the document as that Latin letter. Caps Lock, and **Shift** held with a letter, make no difference. | Starts a word. A letter that the scheme does not use goes into the document as itself. |
| **Space** | Puts the word into the document in Manchu letters, with the forms you picked. | Types a space. |
| **Enter** | Puts the word into the document as you typed it: the letters you picked in their Manchu form, the others in Latin letters. | Goes to the program. |
| **Esc** | Cancels the word: nothing goes into the document. | Goes to the program. |
| **Backspace** | Takes back the last pick; when no letter has a pick, deletes the last letter typed. Deleting the only letter closes the candidate window. | Goes to the program. |
| **1** to **9** and **0**, also on the numeric keypad | Picks the card with that number for the highlighted letter: see [Pick a form with the number keys](#pick-a-form-with-the-number-keys). A number with no card does nothing. | Types the digit. |
| **Up**, **Down** | Moves the highlight to the letter before or after. | Goes to the program. |
| **Left**, **Right** | Moves the highlight to the card before or after; this does not pick the card. | Goes to the program. |
| **Page Up**, **Page Down** | When the word has more letters than the window shows, shows the rows before or after, and highlights the first letter shown. | Goes to the program. |
| **Tab** | Goes to the program. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and the other programs built on Chromium end the word when they get it, so Manju IME first puts the word into the document as you typed it: see [Leaving a word](#leaving-a-word). In other programs, such as Notepad, the word stays open. | Goes to the program. |
| **Ctrl**, **Alt**, or **Win** with another key, and **F1** to **F12** | Go to the program. In Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and the other programs built on Chromium, Manju IME first puts the word into the document as you typed it, as it does for **Tab**; a key that takes you to another program, such as **Alt+Tab** or **Win+D**, drops the word: see [Leaving a word](#leaving-a-word). | Go to the program. |
| **Shift**, tapped | Adds the mark or the apostrophe to the letter before it: see [Tap Shift in the middle of a word](#tap-shift-in-the-middle-of-a-word). | Switches between Latin and Manchu input: see [Switch between Latin and Manchu](#switch-between-latin-and-manchu). |
| `'` | Separates two letters, or, pressed a second time, puts the letters typed into the document as they are, followed by an apostrophe: see [The apostrophe key](#the-apostrophe-key). | Types an apostrophe. |
| `-` | Inserts the Mongolian vowel separator: see [Suffixes](#suffixes). | Types a hyphen. |
| **Shift**+**Space** | Does the same as `-`. | Starts a word that holds only the vowel separator, shown as a dot in the document, with no candidate window. |
| `,` `.` **Shift**+`;` | Adds the Manchu comma ᠈, the Manchu full stop ᠉, or the colon ᠄ to the word: see [Punctuation](#punctuation). | Starts a word with that mark. |
| Any other symbol key, and **Shift** with a digit | Adds the symbol printed on the key, which goes into the document as it is. | Starts a word with that symbol. |
| **Delete**, **Home**, **End** | Change nothing. | Go to the program. |

### Leaving a word

When you switch to another program with **Alt+Tab** in the middle of a word, Manju IME drops the word, as
**Esc** does, and nothing goes into the document. When the program you type in ends the word itself, for
example when Microsoft Edge moves to another field on **Tab**, on a click, or on a key such as **Ctrl+L**
or **F6**, or when you click another window of Edge, the word goes into the document as you typed it:
the letters you picked in their Manchu form, the others in Latin letters.

### Pick a form with the number keys

Each card shows the word with one form of the highlighted letter. To pick a form, press the number of its
card: the letter shows the picked form beside it, and the highlight moves on to the next letter when that
letter has no pick yet. When every letter has a pick, the word goes into the document. Otherwise **Space**
puts it there, and each letter without a pick keeps the form of its first card. Press **Up** or **Down** to
choose the letter first; **Left** and **Right** only move the highlight from card to card.

![The candidate window after typing nama with the Möllendorff input scheme and pressing 2: the last letter shows the form of card 2 beside it, and the window stays open](images/pick.png)

*`nama` typed with the Möllendorff input scheme, then **2**: the last letter shows the form of card 2, and
the word waits for **Space**.*

![Two pages written top to bottom, with the Möllendorff input scheme. On the first, julesi is typed four times, and its last letter is given card 1, 2, 3, and 4 in turn; then bithe four times: its two joined pairs joined, the first apart with 2 on i after Up three times, the second apart with 2 on the last letter, and both apart. On the second, bithe with both pairs apart twice, the pairs picked in one order and then the other; hūwašabumbi with 2 on the u of bu, then on the last letter and on the first; then ama with 2 on its last letter and Space, and ama with 2 and Enter. Each word goes on a line of its own](images/usage-pick.gif)

*Forms picked with the number keys in the Möllendorff input scheme: the last letter of `julesi`
(forward) given each of its four cards; `bithe` (book) with its two joined pairs joined or apart, where
the order of the picks makes no difference; three letters of `hūwašabumbi` picked, the middle one first;
and after a pick, **Space**, which enters the word in Manchu letters with the form picked, and **Enter**,
which enters the letter picked in its Manchu form and the others in Latin letters.*

### Switch between Latin and Manchu

When you are not in the middle of a word, a short tap of **Shift** switches between Latin and Manchu
input. In Latin input the keys type as they do without an IME.

![A vertical page with manju in Manchu letters, then manju in Latin letters after a tap of Shift, then hergen being typed in Manchu after a second tap of Shift](images/shift-latin.png)

*`manju` in Manchu, a tap of **Shift**, `manju` in Latin letters, another tap of **Shift**, and `hergen`
being typed, with the Möllendorff input scheme.*

![A page written top to bottom, with the Möllendorff input scheme: ere, bithe, and be are typed and entered in Manchu letters; a tap of Shift switches to Latin input, and English goes in as Latin letters; another tap of Shift switches back, and gisun and de, then ubaliyambuha with the Manchu full stop, are typed and entered in Manchu letters, three lines in all](images/usage-mixed.gif)

*`ere bithe be English gisun de ubaliyambuha.` (This book was translated into English.) Typed with the
Möllendorff input scheme: a tap of **Shift** switches to Latin input for `English`, and another tap
switches back.*

### Tap Shift in the middle of a word

A standard keyboard has no key for some spellings: the apostrophe in spellings such as `k'`, and `ū`,
`š`, and `ž` in Möllendorff and Norman. For these, type the letters up to the apostrophe, or the letter
without its mark, then tap **Shift**: `k`, then **Shift**, gives `k'` in every scheme but BabelPad and Hu,
and in Möllendorff, `s`, then **Shift**, gives `š`. A second tap changes nothing.

In Möllendorff, `t` and `s` typed one after the other make the one letter `ts`, so **Shift** after them
gives `ts'`. For `t` followed by `š`, type `t`, the `'` key, `s`, then tap **Shift**.
[Spellings typed with Shift](romanisation.md#spellings-typed-with-shift) lists every such spelling of
each scheme.

### The apostrophe key

In the middle of a word, the `'` key separates two letters that would otherwise make one: `ng` gives the
one letter ᠩ, and `n'g` gives ᠨ followed by ᡤ. The `'` key itself does not go into the document. Pressed a
second time, it puts the letters into the document as typed, in Latin letters, followed by an
apostrophe.

![Two candidate windows with the Möllendorff input scheme: nga typed, where the letters typed show ng and a, and n, the apostrophe key, and ga typed, where they show n, g, and a](images/ng-pair.png)

*`nga` and `n'ga`, typed with the Möllendorff input scheme: the `'` key separates `n` from `g`.*

### Punctuation

Three keys give Manchu punctuation: `,` gives the Manchu comma ᠈, `.` gives the Manchu full stop ᠉, and
**Shift**+`;` gives the colon ᠄. Every other symbol key, `[` and `]` included, with or without **Shift**,
gives the symbol printed on it, and in the middle of a word the symbol joins the letters typed.

### Suffixes

In the middle of a word, `-` and **Shift**+**Space** insert the Mongolian vowel separator (U+180E), which
sets a suffix apart from the word before it: `bi`, `-`, `de` gives ᠪᡳ᠎ᡩᡝ. The settings file can make them
insert a narrow no-break space (U+202F) instead.

![A page written top to bottom, with the Möllendorff input scheme: manju-i, bi-de, boo-ci, bithe-be, gurun-i, and niyalma-de, a line each. The hyphen key before each suffix inserts the Mongolian vowel separator, and Space enters the word](images/usage-suffixes.gif)

*The `-` key before each suffix inserts the Mongolian vowel separator: `manju-i`, `bi-de`, `boo-ci`,
`bithe-be`, `gurun-i`, and `niyalma-de`, typed with the Möllendorff input scheme.*

## Input and display schemes

The input scheme is the spelling you type. Pick one in the settings file, `keymap.scheme`:

| Input scheme | Name in the settings file |
|---|---|
| Abkai | `abkai` |
| BabelPad | `babelpad` |
| Hu | `hu` |
| Möllendorff, the default | `mollendorff` |
| Norman | `norman` |
| Refined Romanisation (draft) | `refined` |

The display scheme is the spelling that the letters typed show in the candidate window,
`display.scheme`. The default, `input`, shows what you typed; the name of an input scheme shows that
scheme’s spelling, whatever you typed. It changes only the Latin letters on the screen, not the Manchu
that goes into the document.

*`shun` typed with Refined Romanisation (draft), shown as `šun` with the display scheme set to
Möllendorff.*

## Themes

![The candidate window after typing manju, in each of the eight themes: Windows 11, So Young, Solarized Dark, Court, High Contrast, Bean Green, Google, and Android](images/themes.png)

*The candidate window after typing `manju` with the Möllendorff input scheme, in each theme.*

To choose a theme, set `theme` under `appearance` in the settings file to `windows11`, `soyoung`,
`solarizeddark`, `court`, `highcontrast`, `beangreen`, `google`, or `android`. The next key you press
after saving the file uses the new theme.

- **Windows 11**, the default: light grey, with blue highlights.
- **So Young**: the light colours of Solarized, a colour scheme by Ethan Schoonover, with cyan and
  magenta highlights.
- **Solarized Dark**: the dark colours of Solarized, with blue highlights.
- **Court**: warm gold, with vermilion highlights and gold lines.
- **High Contrast**: black on white, with blue highlights.
- **Bean Green**: pale green, with navy blue highlights.
- **Google**: white, with blue highlights.
- **Android**: deep teal, with white text and yellow-green highlights.

## The settings file

The settings are in `Runtime\Resource\Configuration\configuration.yaml`, in the folder Manju IME is
installed in. It is a YAML file, plain text with one setting per line, and it describes each setting.
`keymap.scheme` is the input scheme and `display.scheme` the display scheme.

Save the file, and most changes apply at the next key you press, half a second or more after saving.
Font settings apply the next time you switch to Manju IME. If the saved file holds a value Manju IME
cannot use, it ignores that version of the file and keeps its current settings. If Manju IME is
installed under `C:\Program Files`, saving the file needs administrator rights.
